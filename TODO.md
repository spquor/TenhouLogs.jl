2. julia strings could be changed to cstrings with indexing
3. hash function for dicts could be optimized

TODO: DATA PROCESSING
1. a tool for displaying current PlayState could be nice
2. some sort of serialization tool for saving records
3. common interface with statistic libs is probably required
